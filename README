      ALERT's KESI - Knowledge Extractor for Structured Information 
==========================================================================

The Knowledge Extractor for Structured Information (or KESI) is a component
of the ALERT platform [1] design to to gather information from source code 
repositories and from issue/bug tracking systems. Once the information has
been gathered, is transformed into a format known by the rest of the
components of the platform and published in an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).

The information obtained by the KESI is critical in the following scenarios:
 - Recommend a developer which bug to solve.
 - Detect duplicated bugs.
 - Let the developer know about buggy parts of the code.
 - Identifying inactive developers and orphaned parts of the code

== Features ==
 - Supports several types of repositories
   - Source Code Management Systems (SCM): Subversion
   - Issue tracking systems (ITS): Bugzilla
 - Uses external tools for gathering information
   - Source Code Management Systems (SCM): CVSAnalY [2]
   - Issue tracking systems (ITS): Bicho [3]
 - Incremental analysis

== Further work ==
 - Support other types of repositories:
   - SCM: CVS, Git
   - ITS: JIRA
 - Publish the changes in the repositories as events in the ESB

== Requirements ==

 - Any implementation of Java Platform, Standard Edition (>= 1.6)
 - JDBC driver for MySQL
 - JavaMail API (>= 1.4.4)
 - ALERT's BrokerClient (= 0.0.1)
 - Petals ESB (= 3.1.1)
 - CVSAnalY (>= 2.0) [2]
 - Bicho (>= 0.9) [3]

== Configuration ==

TODO.

We may include here some info about:
 - Sensors
 - Properties files
 - Paths (tools, pythonpath and so on)
 - Petals ESB
 - Tools
 - Database configuration (for tools)
