/**
 * This abstract class represents the different actions performed in

 * <p>In systems like CVS, where the commit is limited to a single
 * file, there will be only one action per commit. However, most of
 * the version control systems support atomic commits, where several
 * actions are carried out on several files.</p>
 *
 * <p>Keep in mind that the type of the actions are specific for each
 * SCM solution. Though some of them are common such as <em>add</em>,
 * <em>delete</em> or <em>modify</em>, others are just available on a
 * type of repository, like <em>replace</em> for the SVN solution.</p>
